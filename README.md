# Quora Clone 🔍 - React + Firebase Project

A fully functional **Quora Clone** built using **React**, **Firebase**, and **Tailwind CSS**, created during my summer internship at **Celebal Technologies**.

This project replicates the core features of Quora — user authentication, asking and answering questions, and viewing community discussions — all in a clean, modern UI.
